The waveequation2d.py solves the 2D wave equation in a rectangular domain with
a variable wave velocity and damping using the finite difference method and
ghost cells. because of the current incompatability(1. september 2016) between
scitools.easyvizand matplotlib v1.5.1 it is not possible to animate the wave
propagation without incoorporating the animate class, something this program does not handle.
